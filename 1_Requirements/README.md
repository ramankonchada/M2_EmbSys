# WATER CONTROLLER
## Abstract
- It is a simple process to detect the and indicatge the water level present in a water tank or any container.
- This circit helps to caution a person that the water tank has been filled up to certain level, but also indicates that the water level has fallen below the minimum detectable   level.
-  This circuit is important in appliances such as the water cooler where there is a danger of motor-burnout when there is no water in the radiator.
- This circuit of a water controller is designed by the number of levels and the microcontroller shows up in a display at which level the water is filled when the amount of        water is at certain level it will give some signal through buzzer to indicate a person.
- When the water-level is below the minimum detectable level (MDL), the four segment display is arranged to show the digit 0,  when the indicator shows zero then the tank is     empty, when the water reaches through any level that indicates that the water is below some level.
- For example when the water is at level 0 then water level is empty .when the water is at 4th level then the water is full so that it will give caution to a person.  

## High level requirements
- Windows(OS)
- SimulIDE Software:SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with simple electronic circuits and     microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.
- Visual Studio Code:It is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and its a source code editor made by microsoft for windows, linux, and macOS.The features of visual studio code and include support for debugging,syntax highlighting,intelligent code completion,snippets,code refactoring, and embedded Git.

## Low Level Requirements
